## Overview

Hello! Thanks for visiting. I'm Eleana and I'm a Junior Frontend Developer from Greece.

This is an attempt at a responsive fullpage slider with some text and image transitions. The layout changes a little depending on screen sizes. On touch screens the user can also swipe left or right to navigate between slides.

## My process

This was the most JS-heavy project I've worked on yet, so I spent most of time getting things to work. I used local storage to give the user the opportunity to save their preferences. I also used the drag and drop API and the audio API for some extra features.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Next update on this project will add a working menu toggle.
